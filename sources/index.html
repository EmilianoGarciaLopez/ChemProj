            https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/science-sushi/mythbusting-101-sharks-will-cure-cancer/

            This source comes from the very reliable publication Scientific American. It includes many references to
            primary sources and provides reasoning for its claims. I will use this article mainly for the compilation of
            facts that it has,  and the explanation it gives for the rise of this misconception.</p>

            cancer suppression. Nature News. https://doi.org/10.1038/nature.2013.12258

            This article will help me explain the peto paradox since it shows that contrary to expectations, body mass
            doesn’t seem to correlate with cancer rates. It attributes this phenomenon to an increase in cancer
            suppressor genes. This article comes from Nature, which is a credible publication, and it also provides
            evidence and reasoning for its claims.</p>

            This clinical trial provides the data for a clinical trial with or without AE-941 and shows that this shark
            cartilage compound does not affect stage III non-small cell lung cancer. This is a credible  source since it
            comes from the National Library of Medicine and provides ample reasoning and data.</p>

            at Scitable. Nature.com. https://www.nature.com/scitable/topicpage/cell-division-and-cancer-14046590/

            This source provides a brief overview of how cancer forms when it slips through the body’s corrective
            systems.  This is a credible source since it makes no outstanding claims and merely explains science in a
            digestible manner.  “Cancer cells even evade programmed cell death, despite the fact that their multiple
            abnormalities would normally make them prime targets for apoptosis.”
            “Cells become cancerous after mutations accumulate in the various genes that control cell proliferation.”

            https://doi.org/10.3322/canjclin.54.2.110

            This source is credible because it provides ample reasoning and data. I will use this to corroborate my
            claim that shark cartilage does nothing to “cure” cancer.</p>
