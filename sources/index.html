            This article will help me explain the peto paradox since it
            shows that contrary to expectations, body mass doesn&rsquo;t seem to correlate with cancer rates. It
            attributes this phenomenon to an increase in cancer suppressor genes. This article comes from Nature, which
            is a credible publication and makes no unsubstantiated claims. It also provides a works cited list that
            supports the claims in the article.</p>

            This source provides a broad overview of the Peto Paradox and offers some reasons for its existence.
            The video links to a reference claim that contains sources and timestamps for when the sources are used. The
            channel itself is known to be reliable since they frequently consult experts when making a video and issue
            corrections and take down videos that are later proven to be untrue.</p>

            This journal provides the data for a clinical trial with or
            without AE-941 (shark cartilage compound) and shows that this shark cartilage compound does not affect stage III non-small cell lung
            cancer. This is a credible source since it only relies on lab data and clearly explains how this data
            was obtained, making it a repeatable experiment.</p>

            https://www.nature.com/scitable/topicpage/cell-division-and-cancer-14046590/ <br />
            This source provides a
            brief overview of how cancer forms when it slips through the body&rsquo;s corrective systems. This is
            a credible source since it makes no outstanding claims and merely explains science in a digestible manner
            and provides references to many primary sources. This source is more similar to an encyclopedia entry than
            to anything else.</p>
        <p>Vickers, A. (2004). Alternative Cancer Cures: &ldquo;Unproven&rdquo; or &ldquo;Disproven&rdquo;? <em>CA: A

            https://doi.org/10.3322/canjclin.54.2.110 <br />
            This source is credible because it makes no extraordinary
            claims and makes no conclusions that are not directly shown through the data provided. It relies on clinical
            trials that show the effectiveness of alternative forms of cancer treatment. I will use this article to
            substantiate my claim that shark cartilage has been thoroughly proven to be ineffective and utterly useless.

            https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/science-sushi/mythbusting-101-sharks-will-cure-cancer/ <br/>
            This source comes from the very reliable publication Scientific American. It includes many references to primary
            sources and provides reasoning for its claims. I will use this article mainly for the compilation of facts
            that it has, and the explanation it gives for the rise of this misconception.</p>
