            <h1>Why it Matters.</h1>
            <p>
                Since the inception of this myth, millions of sharks have been
                slaughtered to produce cartilage-pills with the supposed effect of
                curing cancer. Few misconceptions have led to such disastrous and
                unnecessary consequences. According to the peer-reviewed journal
                <em>Marine Policy</em>, the number of sharks killed each year in
                commercial fisheries
                <a  target=”_blank” href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0308597X13000055">is estimated to be 100
                    million</a>, many of which are killed to produce useless cartilage supplements.
                In Costa Rica alone, over 2.8 million sharks are killed for the sole
                purpose of producing cartilage pills. This overfishing is reported to
                be much more than what the shark population can sustain, and soon
                these animals may become an endangered species. Additionally, the many
                desperate cancer patients who may be persuaded into purchasing
                shark-cartilage pills are falling for nothing more than a baseless
                scam.

            <h1>Why it's Wrong.</h1>
            <p>
                This myth originated when Henry Brem and Judah Folkman from the Johns
                Hopkins School of Medicine observed that cartilage prevented the
                growth of new blood vessels into tissue. This phenomenon, known as
                angiogenesis, is one of the central components of a malignant tumor.
                From this, they theorized that cartilage must contain some enzyme that
                prevented capillaries from forming. They then tested their hypothesis
                and found that inserting cartilage from baby rabbits alongside
                malignant masses, in experimental animals, prevented the
                <a  target=”_blank” href="https://rupress.org/jem/article/141/2/427/21885/Inhibition-of-tumor-angiogenesis-mediated-by">tumor
                    from increasing in size</a>. However, Dr. I William Lane decided to act on these
                experiments&apos; results and published a book called
                <em>Sharks Don&apos;t Get Cancer</em>, which became a national
                bestseller, and gained the attention of popular television program 60
                minutes. During his segment, he spoke about the seemingly miraculous
                clinical trials he had conducted in Mexico. After his rise to fame, he
                started LaneLabs, which produce shark cartilage pills to this day.
            </p>
            <p>
                However, despite the promising experiment, there is, nor will ever be
                a cure for cancer. This claim cannot be true because the word
                &quot;cancer&quot; itself refers to a wide range of phenomenon
                involving abnormal cell growth, so no matter how advanced medical
                technology becomes, a panacea, like what shark pills purport to be,
                will never exist. Perhaps more importantly, cartilage pills do nothing
                to treat or prevent cancer. Studies from
                <a  target=”_blank” href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9817287/">1998</a>,
                <a  target=”_blank” href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15912493/">2005,</a> and
                <a  target=”_blank” href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20505152/">2007</a>, have all
                unequivocally disproven the claim that sharks &quot;cure&quot; cancer
                in any way, shape, or form.

            <h1>Promising Alternatives.</h1>
            <p>
                Interestingly enough, the vast ocean does offer promising alternatives
                in suppressing cancer. One such alternative is the Peto paradox, named
                after Richard Peto,
                <a  target=”_blank” href="https://bmcbiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12915-017-0401-7">who observed that the
                    probability of cancer progression was related
                    to the duration of exposure to the carcinogen benzpyrene [1]. He
                    later added body mass to the equation, when he wondered why humans
                    both contain 1000 times more cells and live 30 times longer than
                    mice, yet the two species do not suffer incredibly different
                    probabilities of developing cancer.</a>
                In other words, large animals, like blue whales are not dying of
                cancer at the rate which we expect them to.
            </p>
            <p>
                Currently there are two prevalent theories that explain the lack of
                cancer in large animals. The first of these theories states that, the
                lack of cancer in large animals, can be attributed to the evolution of
                some cancer suppressor gene that allows them to survive.
            </p>
            <p>
                The second, perhaps more ludicrous, of these theories suggests that
                large animals develop &quot;hypertumors,&quot; which are quite
                literally tumors on tumors, and that these prevent the original tumor
                from killing the animal. However, if you wish to learn more about this
                phenomenon, I suggest you watch <a  target=”_blank” href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AElONvi9WQ&t=165s">this video</a>.
