                Jennifer Hahn
            </h1>
            
            <p>
                Jennifer  received  her  BFA  in  Printmaking  from  the  Moore  College  of  Art  and  Design  in  Philadelphia  in  1990.    After  graduating,  she  moved  to  New  York  City  where  she  worked  for  Christie’s  Fine  Art  Auction  House,  while  studying  painting  at  the  Art  Student’s  League  of  New  York.    Settling  with  her  family  in  Chapel  Hill,  NC  in  1998,  Jennifer  paints  in  her  studio  on  her  property  in  Orange  County  and  participates  in  regional  shows  of  her  work.

                <br>    
                Jennifer  refers  to  her  paintings  as  “landscape  allusions”,  because  her  work  is  an  indirect  reference  to  a  relationship  with  a  person  or  persons,  an  emotional  state  or  a  current  event.  She  creates  mood  to  describe  the  relationship  and  emotion  through  the  use  of  color  and  the  drama  of  the  sky.    The  landscape  is  representative  of  a  story;  either  her  own  story  or  one  that  others  can  relate  to.  She  views  painting  as  a  vehicle  for  connection  with  people,  and  gives  each  of  her  canvases  a  voice  through  written  thoughts  or  stories  that  accompany  them.
